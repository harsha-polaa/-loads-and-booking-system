2. **Maven**: Maven is used for dependency management and building the project. Make sure it's installed and configured.
3. **PostgreSQL**: Set up a PostgreSQL instance on your machine or use a cloud database provider (e.g., AWS RDS, Heroku Postgres).

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository:**
2. **Configure Database Connection:**
3.Build the Project:
Use Maven to build the project:
4.Run the Application:
Start the Spring Boot application:

##Assumptions
Database Configuration: The application assumes that a PostgreSQL database is used, and the database is accessible via the credentials provided in application.properties.

Data Persistence: The application relies on Hibernate's automatic schema generation (spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update) to manage database tables. Ensure that the database is properly configured.

Error Handling: Error responses are handled by Spring Boot and returned as JSON in case of errors like "Bad Request" or "Not Found."

Security: This version does not implement any security measures (e.g., authentication, authorization). Itâ€™s recommended to add Spring Security or other authentication methods for production environments.
